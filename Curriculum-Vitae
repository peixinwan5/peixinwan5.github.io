I'm a postgraduate student from Lingnan University.My research interest includes photoshop Css and UI .

I am majored in marketing in my undergraduate years, I actively signed up for the second degree in social work, hoping to make up for the shortage of theoretical knowledge with the expectation of dedicating myself to social services. My first degree, marketing, has developed my data analysis ability which is also helpful in this field.
